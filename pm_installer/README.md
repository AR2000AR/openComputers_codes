# PM installation floppy creation tool

## Usage :
- Insert a empty floppy
- run `wget https://github.com/AR2000AR/openComputers_codes/raw/master/pm_installer/download.lua /tmp/pmInstaller.lua`
- run `/tmp/pmInstaller.lua <floppyPath>`. Do not forget to replace `<floppyPath>` with the empty floppy's path
You now have a installation floppy for `pm` and `pm-get`. You can install them with `install`
